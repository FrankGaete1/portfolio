				<p>Once a solid understanding of the requirements and goals has been established, the next step is to review existing UI/UX design priniciples and patterns such as a style guide, design pattern library, best practices and more.</p>
				<p>Depending on the project we may be able to use existing layouts, styles or design patterns. There may be cases where we need to create or modify a new style or design pattern.</p>

				<p>After determining the layouts, styles and design patterns we will use for our initial design concepts, we can start putting together wireframes.</p>
				<p>Wireframes should be monochramitic to avoid distractions such as "why are using that shade of blue?" and allows the reviewing audience to focus on the important elements for which wireframes are intended. These elements include  interface elements we need to display (text, images, buttons, etc), general layout of these elements, relationships between elements and the workflows between elements and/or views.</p>
				<p>Once we have approved wireframes, we use them along with our defined styles, design patterns, etc, to create a "high fidelity" design mockup that demonstrates what a view or set of views will look like in production.</p>

				<p>Depending on factors such as project timeline, overall capacity or defined design approach, we may skip one of the previous phases (wireframe or mockup) and go straight to prototyping.</p>
				<p>In the last few years, I have used Twitter's Bootstrap framework for my rapid prototyping. Benefits of using Bootstrap include: huge popularity and use so it's well documented, easy to use, ability to manipulate layouts within the 12 column grid system, responsive, cross-browser issues have been worked out, and more.</p>
				<p>Prototyping also provides a great time and money savings as we can quickly provide a working HTML/CSS/jQuery sample that allows stakeholders and beta users to get a very good idea of what the views will look and behave like as a user interacting with them. Zero or minimal effort from software engineers is expended until the prototype is approved for the development phase.</p>

		<h3>Project Insights Example: ICS Portal</h3>
		<img src="content/img/site_ics-portal-dashboard_800x600.jpg" class="img-responsive cover" style="margin: 20px 0;">
		<p>Here I describe how design considerations and lifecycle were applied to one of the largest projects I worked on, Broadrige's ICS Portal. This project included several "Bank and Broker" applications, was a "first-of-its-kind" at Broadridge and took over 1 year to complete. </p>
		<h4>Problem</h4>
		<p><!--<span class="sectionTitle1">Problem</span><br>-->
		Create a single sign-on portal for several "Bank and Broker" applications which were designed and developed in silos which resulted in disparate designs, workflows, environments and more. A client (user) licensing several of these applications had to sign in to each application individually and would be restricted to viewing data from only 1 application at a time. We needed to offer users true "SSO" (single sign on) and allow them to view and leverage information, data and assets across all licensed applications.</p>
		<h4>Solution</h4>
		<p>
		Create a portal that included several applications with a consistent and modern UI/UX design, single sign-on functionality, security features, dashboard views with cross-application data views without having to redesign/redevelop each standalone application. 
		Sounds easy right?
		<h4>Planning</h4>
		<p>
		There were several initial concurrent efforts including portal software (ie., third party or write our own); select applications to include; review client feedback that supported the need to offer a portal solution; review standalone applications' design challenges; resource planning; cost estimating and other items that fell into the "sprint 0" phase.
		<h4>UI/UX Approach</h4>
		<p>
		As the UI/UX team lead, I was involved in every design related aspect of this project, including "sprint 0" items such as portal design inspirations, UX research and exploring third party portal software to understand what UI/UX features and functionality it offered.</p>
        <p>To avoid redesigning/redeveloping entire standalone applications, the software engineers created APIs into parts of each standalone app to pull data and functionality in. This allowed us to design a consistent and moderan UI/UX for all applications in the portal, leveraging some existing styles and design patterns, but in many cases we created new styles and patterns.</p>
        <p>This project was enormously challenging but we had a lot of fun with it and received great feedback from our clients.</p>
